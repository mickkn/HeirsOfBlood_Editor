Event1_Intro3.text,Think you can challenge Splig. King of AII Goblins?" he yells, moving toward the river. "Well, good luck getting in there without the key!" With that, he winds his arm back and heaves the key into the water, but his attempt falls pitifully short. The key plops into the shallows along the banks, and you think you can see it glinting beneath the water. His minions grow quiet and turn toward the fat goblin.\n\n"Oh, forget that. Get 'em'" Splig screams, hefting his club to his shoulder
